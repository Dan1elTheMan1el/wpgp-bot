### Version 1.2.3

# Features

After installing, the bot will automatically monitor the heartbeat channel and determine which discord members are actively rerolling or not. Then, it will assign roles and update an `ids.txt` file on github, which is referenced by all AHK Farmers in the server! This allows for seamless joining/leaving sessions with no interaction apart from starting / stopping the ahk script.

The bot also organizes all user data into one discord channel, summarizing packs found, hours grinded, instances running, etc.

# Usage Instructions

## AHK Setup

- Friend ID: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{GITHUB_USER}/{GITHUB_REPO}/refs/heads/main/ids.txt`

    - Name: *User's discord ID*
    - Webhook URL: *Webhook created in Heartbeat channel*
